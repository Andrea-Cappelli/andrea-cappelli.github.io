7-3      Bottom Jain state [7,3] in the notation of the paper

111      J value

j1 -j5   Jain state corresponding to a particle-hole excitation 
         of the bottom state |\Omega>, e.g. |[7,3]> or |[5,3,1]>.
         In the Fock-space notation of the paper, 
         (operators d, d^+, u, u^+, ...), we have:

\delta J=1  j1  ->  d^+_1 d_0 |\Omega>  or   j1  ->  d^+_1 d_0 |\Omega>
            j2  ->  u^+_1 u_0 |\Omega>       j2  ->  c^+_1 c_0 |\Omega>
                                             j3  ->  u^+_1 u_0 |\Omega>  

\delta J=2  j1  ->  d^+_2 d_0          |\Omega>
            j2  ->  d^+_1 d_{-1}       |\Omega>
            j3  ->  d^+_1 d_0 u^+_1 u_0|\Omega>
            j4  ->  u^+_2 u_0          |\Omega>
            j5  ->  u^+_1 u_{-1}       |\Omega>
