 =========================

 - A. Cappelli, M. Riccardi, G.R. Zemba; 
 ``Conformal field theories for the quantum Hall effect''
   Explore other physical applications of the Laughlin state and its
   characteristic W-infinity symmetry. Study the description offered by 
   the non-commutative Chern-Simons field theory proposed by L. Susskind.
   Study the relation of Laughlin's plasma of vortices with confinement
   in gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions.

 - A.Cappelli, G. D'Appollonio, M. Zabzine 
 ``Boundary conformal field theories''
   Develop a Landau-Ginzburg description of the boundary 
   states and of the boundary renormalization-group flows.
   Proof that the boundary entropy monotonically decreases along these flows.

- F. Colomo, A. G. Pronko
``Finite-size corrections to the Partition Function of the 6-vertex model''
The six vertex model with domain-wall boundary conditions is being actively
analyzed, also in connection with the theory of alternating 
sign matrix and domino tilings. We are building a systematic procedure to
 compute the finite-size corrections to the partition function.

- M. Pettini, R. Franzosi, L. Casetti
``Topological theory of phase transitions''
  The singularities which appear at a thermodynamic phase transition can
  be attributed to special kinds of topology changes of equipotential
  submanifolds of configuration space, thus providing a more fundamental
  description of these phenomena with respect to measure-theoretic approaches. 

- M. Pettini, G. Ciraolo, R. Lima
``Control of chaos and transport in thermonuclear fusion plasmas''
  Development of open-loop control strategies of the anomalous chaotic 
  transport of particles - transversally to the confining magnetic field - 
  in thermonuclear controlled fusion devices of the tokamak type.

- S. Ruffo, M. Antoni, J. Barre', T. Dauxois, M.C. Firpo, H. Hinrichsen,
  F. Leyvraz, D. Mukamel 
 ``Dynamics and statistics in systems with long-range interactions''
  Long-range interactions lead to inequivalences between the canonical and
  microcanonical ensambles and to metastable states whose lifetime
  goes to infinity with the size of the system.

- S. Ruffo, R. Khomeriki, S. Lepri
 ``Localized excitations in non-linear lattices''
   Clusters of ``breathers'' can be produced in the FPU lattices by
   exciting the modes at the band edges.

- S. Ruffo, H. Larralde, F. Leyvraz, G. Martinez-Mekler, R. Rechtman
 ``Diffusion in the Lorentz gas model''
  The random walk model nicely represents the diffusive motion in
  the diluted Lorentz gas model.

- S. Ruffo, D. Fanelli, M. Merafina
 ``Toy models of globular clusters''
   Adsorbing boundary conditions reproduce the King distributions of
   self-gravitating clusters.

-F. Bagnoli, M. Bezzi, R. Rechtman, F. Cecconi, N. Boccara, , P. Palmerini
   ``Phase transitions for out-of-equilibrium systems and synchronization''
   We study the dynamics of out-of-equilibrium phase transitions both
   numerically and analytically by applying models of the synchronization
   problem.

-  F. Bagnoli, F. Bochiccio, S. Bucci;
 ``Models for the sensitivity of passive radon detectors''
   Passive radon detectors are widely used for large-scale epidemic
   studies; we participate to a research project for deducing
   their sensitivity as a function of the specific features of
   detector, such that the geometry, the thicknes of the adsorber etc.

-  M. Zabzine, C. Albertsson, U. Lindstrom
  ``Supersymmetric two-dimensional sigma models with boundaries''
   We study the most general solution for the N=1 supersymmetric boundary
   conditions in these models.

  application to nonlinear sigma models with topologic terms within the
  framework of form factor perturbation theory.

``Quantum field theory at finite temperature''
  A recent numerical study has confirmed the theoretical predictions for
  the one-point functions. Future investigation should concentrate on
  the large distance, low-temperature expansion for the two-point functions.

  critical antiferromagnet; computation of universal characteristics of
