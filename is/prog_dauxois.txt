1) Metastability and Non extensive statistical mechanics
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Collaborations: Stefano Ruffo, Julien Barre, Freddy Bouchet

We have recently shown and explained the striking emergence of
coherent structures in the HMF model. We think that this model is a
good candidate, in its ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic version, to
study precisely not only anomalous diffusion, but also to test the
generalized statistical Mechanics proposed by Tsallis and
collaborators.


2) Reduced model for the description of radiation matter
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Collaborations:  Stefano Ruffo, Julien Barre, Freddy Bouchet, Antonio
Politi

We would like to study a recently proposed model which describe light
matter interaction and collision with an external buffer gaz. The
model based on the CARL model include a self-consistent treament of the
Bloch Maxwell equations and of the recoil due to the pump field. As
dynamical quantities show striking similarities with the HMF model
that we solved recently, we would like to apply similar techniques in
the Hamiltonian limit of this model


3) Clustering and ensembles inequivalence in mean-field hamiltonian models

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Collaborations: Stefano Ruffo,  Stefano Lepri

We would like to investigate a model of globally coupled conservative
oscillators. Two different algebraic potentials are considered that
display either a first or second order phase transition in the
canonical ensemble. The stability of highly clustered states is
studied analytically. Numerical simulations show that ensemble
equivalence breaks down for some class of initial data.
